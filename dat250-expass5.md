## Laboratory report

#### > technical problems that you encountered during installation of the software development environment and how you have solved them
Was a bit confusing whether or not I should create a new project from scratch per tutorial, or if I should use the same project for all tutorials. I decided to use the same project for all tutorials, and just add the new dependencies as needed.
